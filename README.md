# BtagEfficiencyMaps

BTagging efficiency requires two numbers to calculate the final weight factor:
1. SF from POG
2. Efficiency calculated for different background processes as a function of Pt and Eta. The efficiency is calculated due to the dependence of the bTagging on event kinematics.

Combining these two numbers in a certain fashion provides us a final bTagging SF.
