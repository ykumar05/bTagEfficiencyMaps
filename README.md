# BtagEfficiencyMaps

BTagging efficiency requires two numbers to calculate the final weight factor:
1. SF from POG
2. Efficiency calculated for different background processes as a function of Pt and Eta. The efficiency is calculated due to the dependence of the bTagging on event kinematics.

Combining these two numbers in a certain fashion provides final bTagging SF. 

Refer to Section 1(a) of https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/BTagSFMethods for the exact implementation of these numbers.
